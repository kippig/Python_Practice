    You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams. Given a scale
    that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle? You can only use the scale once.

    Put 1 pill from bottle 1, 2 pills from bottle two, n pills from bottle n on the scale. The total weight will have a
    unique value 1 + 2 + .. + n + 0.1*x where x is the bottle number = n(n+1)/2 + 0.1x = 20(21)/2 + 0.1x = 210.x

    so 210.9 means bottle 9 weighs more, 211.9 means bottle 19.

    You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two games.
    Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
    Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.
    If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick one game or the other?

    When is p >= (3 2)p^2(1-p) + p^3 => p >= 3p^2(1-p) + p^3 = 3p^2 - 3p^3 + p^3 = 3p^2 - 2p^3 =>
        2p^3 - 3p^2 + p >= 0 => p(2p^2 - 3p +1) >= 0, p = 0 or p = 3+-sqrt(9-4*2)/2 = 1.5 +- 1 =
            p = 0, p = 2.5, p = 0.5. so when p>= 0.5 we should play game 1.

    There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off. You are given 31 dominos,
    and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board?
    Prove your answer (by providing an example or showing why it's impossible).

    in the base case, 4x4, we can put two dominoes in the middle, and then 4 dominoes on the edges parallel to them.
    Assume there exists a pattern for a 2n x 2n square. Consider a square of size 2(n+1) x 2(n+1), if we remove the
    corners they are of size 2n, which is even so we can fit dominoes parallel to the corners. The middle is a size
    2n x 2n square, since each row of this square is even, we can fit n dominoes into each row of the square. Since the
    middle square and the edges are filled out, then we have a pattern filling a 2(n+1) x 2(n+1) square proving
    that such a pattern exists for all even size squares.

    There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is the probability of collision (between any two
    or all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the triangle? Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction,
    with either direction being equally likely to be chosen, and that they walk at the same speed. Similarly,
    find the probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon.

    we want P(all ants go same direction) = P(ant 1 goes any direction)*P(ant 2 matches ant 1 | ant 1 goes any direction)
    * ... * P(ant n matches ant 1| ants 1...n-1 go the same direction) = P(ant 1 goes any direction)*P(ant 2 matches)*
    ...*P(ant n matches) due to independence. Thus P(all ants go same direction) = 1*(1/2)^n-1

    You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would
    you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such thatf illing up exactly
    "half" of the jug would be impossible.

    fill up jug 3 and pour into jug 5. Jug 5 has 3 quarts, jug 3 has 0. Fill up jug 3 and pour into jug 5, jug 5 has 5
    quarts, and jug 3 has 1. Empty jug 5, pour jug 3 into it and then another jug 3 into jug 5. Jug 5 then has 4 quarts.

     A bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes with a strange order: all blue-eyed people must
     leave the island as soon as possible. There will be a flight out at 8:00 pm every evening. Each person can see
     everyone else's eye color, but they do not know their own (nor is anyone allowed to tell them). Additionally,
     they do not know how many people have blue eyes, although they do know that at least one person does.
     How many days will it take the blue-eyed people to leave?

     1 day, everyone can leave on day 1. This question is worded poorly. Would you risk staying longer than you had to?

     They do know how many people have blue eyes because "Each person can see everyone else's eye color". So let's say,
     1 person has blue eyes. They see everyone else has green eyes. They leave on night 1. All the green eyed people see
     this and know that the person knew they all had green eyes so they can remain. if there's n blue eyed people then
     they wait until day n and see if anyone has left. Each blue eye person can see n-1 others, so if they all left on
     day n-1 they would know they were green. However, since they didn't, the nth blue eyed person knows their eyes are
     blue and leaves on day n.

    In the new post-apocalyptic world, the world queen is desperately concerned about the birth rate. Therefore, she
    decrees that all families should ensure that they have one girl or else they face massive fines. If all families
    abide by this policy-that is, they have continue to have children until they have one girl, at which point they
    immediately stop-what will the gender ratio of the new generation be? (Assume that the odds of someone having a boy
    or a girl on any given pregnancy is equal.) Solve this out logically and then write a computer simulation of it.

    we're looking for E[G] = SUM( G*P(G) for all G) = 1*1, since every family will have a girl. E[B] = SUM( B*P(B))
    = 0*1/2 + 1*1/4 + 2*1/8 + 3/16 + 4/32 = n/2^(n+2)
               1/4  +  1/8  + 1/16 + ... + 1/2^n + .. = 1/2
                       1/8  + 1/16 + ... + 1/2^n + .. = 1/4
                              1/16 + ... +            = 1/8
                                                      + ...
                                                      1/2
    The probabilities are equal.

    There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above, it will break. If it's dropped from
    any floor below, it will not break. You're given two eggs. Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the
    worst case.

   drop the egg on floor 14, 14+13, 14+13+12+... basically given S stories, drop the egg on floor N where
   N + (N - 1) + (N-2) + .. + 1 < S. this simplifies to N + N + N... + (-1 -2 -3 -...N) = N^2 - N(N+1)/2 = N^2/2 - N/2
   = (N^2 - N)/2 = S, then N^2 - N - 2S = 0. Quadratic formula gives you positive N, then round down.

    There are 100 closed lockers in a hallway. A man begins by opening all 100 lockers. Next, he closes every second
    locker. Then, on his third pass, he toggles every third locker (closes it if it is open or opens it if it is
    closed). This process continues for 100 passes, such that on each pass i, the man toggles every ith locker. After
    his 100th pass in the hallway, in which he toggles only locker #100, how many lockers are open?

    this question is, how many prime numbers are there between 0 and 100, if you have an odd number of factors you are
    prime. Proof, say N < 100 and  N = j1 * j2 * ... * jn, every number k1 = {some j_i for i < n } will have a pair N/k1,
    unless the number is prime and that divisor is 1. so the number of open lockers is every composite number.
    so 100 - |{2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97}| = 75 are open. Except prime numbers
    have an even number of factors, we need perfect squares actually.

    You have 1000 bottles of soda, and exactly one is poisoned. You have 10 test strips which can be used to detect
    poison. A single drop of poison will turn the test strip positive permanently. You can put any number of drops on
    a test strip at once and you can reuse a test strip as many times as you'd like (as long as the results are
    negative). However, you can only run tests once per day and it takes seven days to return a result. How would you
    figure out the poisoned bottle in as few days as possible?

    Naive solution:
        split into groups of 100, 7 days, 9 strips left
        split into groups of 11, 14 days, 8 strips left
        split into groups of 2,2,2,2,1,1,1, 21 days,  1 strip left
        splits into group of 1, 1 28 days, 0 strips.

    Clever solution
        split into groups of 100, and then put group 900s evens on group 1, group 100s evens on group then if there's
        a test 4,5 lit up you know it's in the 400s and even getting us down to 50. Can we encode even more information?
        Yes, group 10 has #901-1000, it also has the evens from 801-800, and the 3s from 700-701 but no information from
        group 1. Then if group 1 is positive, we know it's a number between 1-100 that is divisble (or not) by 2,3,4,5
        ,7,11,13,17. unfortunately this leaves around 50 left but only 1 strip, so we need to sieve more.

        design the test so that the first strip in our ring Group(1-10), indicates the 100s place, the second indicates
        the 50 split, the 3rd indicates the 25, 4th the 12, 5th the 6, 6th, 3 7th, 2, 8th, 1

        so 95 is in group 1 since the hundreds is 0
        it is not in group 2 since it's > 50
        it is not in group 3 since it is > 75
        it is not in group 4 since it is > 87
        it is not in group 5 since it is > 93
        it is in group 6 since < 96
        it is not in group 7 since > 94
        group 8 and 9 are not needed, since group 9 is always empty for bottles 1-100, we know the first information
        comes from group 1...

        7 day solution.
