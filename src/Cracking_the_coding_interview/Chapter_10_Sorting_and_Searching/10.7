Missing Int: Given an input file with four billion non-negative integers, provide an algorithm to generate an
integer that is not contained in the file. Assume you have 1 GB of memory available for this task.

What if you have only 10 MB of memory? Assume that all the values are distinct and we now have no more than
one billion non-negative integers.

scan the entire file for the max, then take max + 1, O(n) runtime.
In python we can do this in O(1) time by picking an integer that is bigger than the file size to write 10^(filesize)
(assuming the input file isn't compressed).
