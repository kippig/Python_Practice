catcatgocatgo

aabab

candidates for a:

a starts with c.

find all locations with c.

0, 3, 8
so a must but 'cat'

then when we subtract a from the string and divide it by number of bs.


Step 1:
if pattern starts with 'b', swap a and b.

if there are multiple 'as' figure out A
if there are not multiple as figure out b.


once normalized:


catcatgocatgo

a = c

[0, 3, 7], if this array is smaller than num_a, return false

try a = c, try a = ca, a = cat
