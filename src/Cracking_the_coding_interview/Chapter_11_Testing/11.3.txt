ChessTest :We have the following method used in a chess game:
    boolean canMoveTo(int x, int y).
This method is part of the Piece class and returns whether or not the piece can move to position (x, y). Explain how
you would test this method.

1. instantiate a board
2. create one of each piece on the board (except King which requires its own testing due to check/checkmate positions)
    a. make sure to test en passant and other pawn moves
3. test out of bounds on the board, put pieces in the way of each piece (probably with a loop).
4. test ability to capture, so need both types of pieces
5. Test check/checkmates. Can the king move into check. Are there moves avaialble when in checkmate formations
